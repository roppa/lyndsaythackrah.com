		            <p>The Treasure Chest - Building an E-Commerce Website</p>

								<p>The Treasure Chest is a retailer of toys, games, and magic tricks. For over 30 years it has successfully focused on traditional toys, but have moved with the times and now offers a full range of new and vintage products to appeal to children and adults alike. They are looking for an e-commerce site to be developed.
							</div>

							<h2>Project Overview</h2>
							<p>This student project involved aspects of user research, producing low fidelity wire frames and working with opposing stakeholder goals. Our task was to research the client's market to help propose a bespoke e-commerce website which we would then test and iterate upon accordingly.</p>

							<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
							<p>Understanding the current market was imperative in order to the competition The Treasure Chest would have. I researched big brands, small brands and special players in an e-commerce setting.</p>

							<img src="assets/img/treasure-chest/competitive-analysis.jpg" alt="Competitive analysis" />

							<h2>Personas</h2>
							<img src="assets/img/treasure-chest/personas.jpg" alt="Personas">

							<h2>Stakeholder Interviews</h2>
							<p>I interviewed the Stakeholders to gain insight from their extensive knowledge about their business and it's needs, to the customer experiences they currently offered. I asked about their future plans along with their biggest pain points from their standpoint and their customers.</p>

							<h2>Design Development</h2>
							<p>The shop had a large catalogue of products and the first step was to organise them into likely categories. Multiple sortings and iterations later I had a common themed category map.</p>

							<img src="assets/img/treasure-chest/card-sort.jpg" alt="Card sorting">

							<h2>Synthesis</h2>
							<p>Using the already existing personas, the competitive analysis and the stakeholder interviews, I brought all of the relevant points together and came up with some basic sketches.</p>

							<img src="assets/img/treasure-chest/synthesis.jpg" alt="Synthesis" />

							<h2>User testing the sketches</h2>

							<p>Users told me they were unsure of how to browse, they could see how to search for something specific but wanted to get inspiration for a purchase. The low fidelity wireframes (below) show the changes that were made. </p>

							<blockquote>"How do I keep up with what’s going on in store? E.g. what’s new in?"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I can’t find where to browse the shop?"</blockquote>
						
							<h2>Low Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
							<img src="assets/img/treasure-chest/wireframe.jpg" alt="Wireframe" />

							<blockquote>"Simple layout, not too much detail. Easy to use"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"Easy to follow. I can achieve what I want"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I love that I can see all the new arrivals and events"</blockquote>
							<blockquote>"I like the browser at the top of the page"</blockquote>

	            <p>A mobile travel app to facilitate an easy to follow and tailored way around a new city whilst providing an educational experience.</p>

	            <h2>Challenge</h2>
	            <p>Rand McNally is known for charting and producing maps, atlases, textbooks and globes.  In the digital world, they offer GPS devices for consumers and commercial trucking. They've identified geocaching as a burgeoning industry in which they have potential.  Our primary consideration is to develop a mobile travel app to introduce to the market a Rand McNally virtual geoaching app for tourists.</p>

	            <h2>My role(s)</h2>
	            <ul>
								<li>Project manager</li>
								<li>Personas</li>
								<li>User flow</li>
								<li>Presentation</li>
								<li>Iteration</li>
								<li>Sketches</li>
								<li>Wireframes</li>
								<li>Prototyping</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>The Process</h2>
							<img src="assets/img/rand-mcnally/process.png" alt="Rand McNally UX design process">
	            
	            <h2>Proposed Solution</h2>
	            <p>A travel app for mobile which leverages the company's current assets (maps, atlases, GPS technology) to introduce the user to a world of virtual caching whilst learning about the city. A bespoke tour just for you.</p>

	            <h1>1. Understand User Needs </h1>
	            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
	            <p>The travel market is saturated, however none focus on digital touring. We completed a S.W.O.T. analysis of various company's offerings and apllied our findings to the design of the app.</p>

	            <h2>User Research</h2>
	            <p>User research took many directions from interviewing Geocachers, surveying travellers needs and conducting in depth interviews with regular travellers.</p>

	            <h2>Consumer Insights</h2>
	            <p>The most commonly used words in the answers to the user surveys can be seen on the right.  The bigger the word the more times it was used. </p>
	            <p>The key takeaways from our research were:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Users wanted app based travel information</li>
								<li>With local tidbits of information</li>

							<h1>3. Iterate - Initial Sketches</h1>
							
							<p>Initial sketches were drawn based on our research findings and user interviews. Being able to explore near to a user's current location and being able to search in advance and save the tour, were important. Also having different views (birds eye, walking) and information about the attraction is key the choosing the tour.</p>
							<img src="assets/img/rand-mcnally/paper-prototype.png" alt="">
							<h3>Key insights: </h3>
							<p>The first user test told us that users wanted:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>To be able to check current location and be able to search in advance</li>
								<li>Users wanted to see different views e.g. birds eye, walking</li>
								<li>Informtion about the attraction being showcased</li>
							</ul> 

							<h1>4. Prototype</h1>
							<p>After testing the prototype below, users told us they wanted:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>A back button in case they wanted to amend choice on a previous page </li>
								<li>Simplified choices for views; a map and a list showing the waypoints to be visited</li>
								<li>A sense of acheivement,;so we added a “collect coins” aspect at each waypoint.</li>
							<img src="assets/img/rand-mcnally/paper-protoype-second-iteration.png" alt="">

							</ul>

							<h1>5. Validate</h1>
							<p>The second round of user testing (testing the prototype) told us that users:</p>
							
							
							<ul>
								<li>wanted to customise their tour rather than have a set tour</li>
								<li>did not like the rewards system for reaching each waypoint (coins)</li>
								<li>wanted the design to be a little more mature</li>
								<li>wanted an audio feature so they didn't have to look down at their phone during their route</li>

							<p>Peekapak is an arts based character education program which offers Social and Emotional learning (SEL) through beautifully illustrated stroies. Our design team developed a child facing platform to complement the already existsing teachers' and parents' platforms, as a potential source of revenue.</p>

							<h2>Project Overview</h2>

							<p>My team designed an interactive platform which creates an environment that merges magic, play and fun for the child to learn. In addition, we redesigned the parent facing platform to enable parents to be fully engaged in the social and emotional learning of their child.</p>

							<h2>The process</h2>

							<p>We started out by researching Social and Emotional Learning for children and why it's important for a child's long term success. We dove into the current offerings of Peekapak, from the view of the teacher and the parent and finally what was currently available in the market, who might be a competitor to Peekapak.</p>

							<h2>Ideate</h2>
							<p>We arranged an ideation session with the stakeholders where all worked individually to come up with ideas for the child's platform. Afterwards, the affinity map was produced. These ideas were used to begin sketching.</p>
