    <h1>Rand McNally - Travel App</h1>
    <p>A mobile travel app to facilitate an easy to follow and tailored way around a new city whilst providing educational experience </p>

    <h2>Challenge</h2>
    <p>Rand McNally is known for charting and producing maps, atlases, textbooks and globes.  In the digital world, they offer GPS devices for consumers and commercial trucking. They’ve identified geocaching as a burgeoning industry in which they have potential.  Our primary consideration is to develop a mobile travel app to introduce to the market a Rand McNally virtual geoaching app for tourists.</p>

    <h2>Result</h2>
    <p>A travel app for mobile which leverages the company’s current assets (maps, atlases, GPS technology) to introduce the user to a world of virtual caching whilst learning about the city. A bespoke tour just for you.</p>

    <h1>Competetive Analysis</h1>
    <p>To better our understanding of geocaching with a tourism twist,  we researched a range of companies who we thought could be in direct competition with Rand McNally.  Companies such as Lonely Planet, Google Now, Trip Advisor, My Tours and Waymarking.  We completed a S.W.O.T. analysis of each company’s offerings and apllied our findings to the design of the app.</p>
